# streaming-search-project
This app is simple. Choose your streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play, iTunes); input a movie or TV show; get your show information and where you can stream it. Some shows will get you multiple results (i.e. Terminator).

# Responsibilities
I made the Utelly API calls to get the streaming information for a movie or TV show. With that information, I added hyperlinks to the streaming website where you can view the show. I also added radio buttons for Movie or TV Show in order to make the API call to The Movie Datbase to get the show information. The most important thing I did was render multiple results based on the number of results Utelly API returned and the selected streaming services.
